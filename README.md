## CellMAPtracer: A user-friendly tracking tool for long-term migratory and proliferating cells.  

### Getting Started
CellMAPtracer is built using MATLAB (v 9.8) and can be freely obtained as: (A) a standalone executable program for Microsoft Windows, macOS or GNU/Linux; (B) a MATLAB App/Toolbox; and (C) the source MATLAB code. 

#### (A)  CellMAPtracer standalone executable program. 
Navigate to https://github.com/ocbe-uio/CellMAPtracer/releases/tag/v1.0. Three assets of CellMAPtracer for Windows, Linux and macOS versions can be found and downloaded. After downloading the version compatible with your Operating System, users should uncompress the file and follow the instructions in the corresponding “readme.txt”. 
#### (B) CellMAPtracer MATLAB App
To be able to run CellMAPtracer App within the MATLAB environment, users should follow three simple steps: 1) Download the “App” folder from the CellMAPtracer repository: https://github.com/ocbe-uio/CellMAPtracer. 2) In MATLAB, go to APPS tab and click 'Install App' and find ”CellMAPtracer.mlappinstall” then install it. 3) Open CellMAPtracer App from Application list in MATLAB.

#### C) CellMAPtracer from the source MATLAB code
To be able to run CellMAPtracer code, users should clone the CellMAPtracer repository from https://github.com/ocbe-uio/CellMAPtracer and then run “CellMAPtracer_Main.m” after opening a project in MATLAB.
